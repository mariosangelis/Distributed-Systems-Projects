# ECE348 Distributed Systems Team Projects

#### Project1:
>  Implementation of an asynchronous request-reply middleware with semantics at most once and load-balancing with basic API support. <br>

#### Project2:
>  Implementation of a middleware that supports group communication with reliable multicast and total order messaging delivery. This protocol was tested with a chat application. <br>

#### Project3
>  Implementation of a software network file system middleware (using NFS semantics) via remote procedure calls(RPCs). Also, we implemented software caching on the client-side. <br>

#### Project4
>  Implementation of a mobile code middleware. Creation of a distributed execution environment that supports the interpretation and execution of a Simple-Script(basic language) program. This Simple-Script language supports basic operations and send/receive commands with CSP semantics. The middleware supports the strong migration of a Simple-Script program to another machine/environment. <br>
